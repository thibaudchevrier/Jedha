    "# Create a branch\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new branch, simply add the name of the branch you want to create to the command above:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git branch branch_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing a branch\n",
    "\n",
    "It is now necessary to be able to access this newly created branch. The following command will do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git checkout branch_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Merging branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the code you wrote on your new branch works, you can merge your branch into the master branch in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git merge branch_name_you_would_like_to_merge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING, it is important to understand in which branch you are in when you make a `git merge`. If you are on the `master` branch and you are doing `git merge`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "one_branch, you will merge the branch one_branch to the master branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Delete a branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is useful to know how to delete a branch that is no longer useful. To do this, you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git branch -d branch_you_want_delete\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: You cannot delete a branch if you are on it. If you try to do so, an error will appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a pull request\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to collaborate on a project with other people, chances are you won't merge your branches directly locally. Instead, you will go to Github and create a _pull request_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _pull request_ allows you to request a branch merge via Github. This allows other people to view your work, add comments before you officially merge the branches. So it's a very useful extra security feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a pull request, you must first create a branch and do a _git push_ of your branch to your Github repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git checkout -b new_branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before doing a push,** issue the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git pull remote_name branch_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The pull command ensures that you are up to date in the code that has been deposited in the repository. Once you are up to date on your machine, you can do :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git push remote_name branch_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have done this, go to Github in your repository and click on _pull requests_ then _New Pull Request_.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1AbWxZ85K8HKS0s6LAPrb2lMzvPaUHKt-)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you should see the branch you did a _git push_ on and that you can merge into\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1qu48hYjpVCFVTAp88ch4O2cbxq6y9x-O)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have selected it, you can press _Create New Pull Request,_ give it a name and a first comment. Once this is done, you can click on _merge pull request_ and that's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1t0HBnyGB8SNGmLwvt6INdKJKs5s1x5R3)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the tabs of this branch, you can see all the different commits and changes that have been made:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TNqBclxUKmegb5AfVudRF2OUUx54aNtc)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can look at the code and comment as you wish to collaborate on the project before merging the branches.\n",
