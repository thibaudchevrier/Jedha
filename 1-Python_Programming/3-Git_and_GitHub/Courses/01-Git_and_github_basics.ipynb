    "## What you will learn in this course\n",
    "\n",
    "As you grow up as a developer, you will need to collaborate on projects. Writing code together on the same project can be a nightmare if you don't know how to do it. This course will teach you how to develop as a team. After the course, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Understand the Version Control System (VCS)\n",
    "*   Use Git with the terminal and posting your code to Github\n",
    "*   Use branches and making commits and pull requests\n",
    "*   Collaborate on a development project using the agile method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git & Github\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Git and VCS ?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you code for a project, you may have several versions to make of it. For example, you have a first file:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myproject.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you decide to improve the project, so you created a copy of this file that you called :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myproject_V2.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And then, it is possible that you have a third version of the project and that you have made a new copy of your file, etc. You can keep going this way for a little while longer, but as your project becomes more and more complex, you will find it hard to keep it all in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what a VCS or Version Control System is for. Thanks to this system, you will be able to automatically and serenely create versions of your projects without losing or breaking the initial code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these VCSs is Git, which is the most popular and most used of all. So we're going to learn how to use it to work on complex projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What about Github ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is it ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a VCS and you use it, it's very good, but there's even more powerful. Imagine that you don't even have to exchange your files from machine to machine between collaborators anymore, but you can put everything in the cloud so that all authorized people have access to the resources at any time. That's the Github principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to this tool, you will be able to create what we call \"repositories\" and put your projects in them, interact with all the people who collaborate on one of them and deploy them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Github, you can have a personal profile, which can be part of an organization (ex: Jedha). Let's explain a little bit about both.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your profile\n",
    "\n",
    "As in all social networks, to access Github, you need to have a profile. It's as simple as that. Just go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and enter :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A github username\n",
    "2. An email\n",
    "3. A password\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have all that, you can start using the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see that on your profile you'll see :\n",
    "\n",
    "* The deposits you have\n",
    "* The deposits you follow via the _stars_\n",
    "* Your number of followers\n",
    "* The number of people you follow\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to set up anything on your account, just go to the right side of the navigation bar, click on your avatar and a dropdown menu should appear where you can see the account settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Being part of an organization\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are in a tech company, it is highly likely that this company has a \"page\" on Github. Instead of calling it a \"Page\", it is actually called an organization. This is used to create teams of people working on common projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "With an organization, you can create its own repositories, manage who has access to the repositories, and manage team projects. It is very useful to create an organization or to be part of one if you have to work with a lot of people on the project. As we use Git & Github, you'll get a better understanding of how it all works. So let's get to the heart of the matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Git on the Terminal for Your Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's get into the hard stuff and learn how to use Git and Github for complex projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Download Git\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you'll need to download Git to your machine so you can use the controls on your console. To do this, you'll need to go to this link:\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://git-scm.com/downloads]\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the operating system that matches your computer's operating system, and within minutes, Git will be installed on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set up your username and email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing to check before you start coding is to see if your Git is set up with the right username and email.\n",
    "\n",
    "So open your console and enter the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git config --global user.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If your username that appears is the right one, fine. If you need to change it, just do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"votre nom\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then have to do the same with your email. The process is the same, you will simply need to replace `.name` with `.email` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git config --global user.email\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow Git to associate your name and email with the contributions you make in the code. WARNING, the username on Git is different from the username on Github. Just because you have a username A on Git doesn't mean that it will be the same on Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a repository on Github\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now come to Github's main tool: the repository. A repository is a folder where you can put all your files and store them in the cloud so that others can collaborate on them. So let's see how you can create a :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Github navigation bar, you will see a \"+\" sign: click on it to create a new repository.\n",
    "2. Give your deposit a name\n",
    "3. You can also give a description to your deposit to give more details about the purpose of the deposit.\n",
    "4. Then choose whether the repository is public, i.e. visible to everyone, or private. WARNING, having private deposits is not free.\n",
    "5. Initialize a README.md file, a gitignore and a license type if needed. We will develop these points later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created the repository, we will export the code you created locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Do the first commit\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is a commit ?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, our repository is empty. To add content to, you need to do what is called a _commit_. That is to say a backup of our files at a T-tempo. Let's see how to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Create a local folder\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to create a local folder in which we will have the code we want to put in our Github repository. To do this, nothing could be easier, go to your console, select a location for your folder and then create the folder. As a reminder :\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving in the console: `cd`\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a directory: `mkdir`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're in your folder, you'll need to initialize Git with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will initialize Git in the folder you're in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done this step, you can see what has been exported or is still only locally in your machine via :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python.\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git status\n",
    "On branch master\n",
    "\n",
    "No commits yet\n",
    "\n",
    "Untracked files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "\n",
    "README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can see that:\n",
    "* we are on the _master_ branch \n",
    "* we haven't made any commits yet *\n",
    "* we have a file that Git doesn't track, which is: README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add a file to a commit\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to make our first commit, we'll have to do :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git add file_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git add README.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you type again: _git status_, you'll see that now the _README.md_ file appears in green. That is, it is ready to be exported. If you rewrite the file, it will reappear in red and you'll have to redo a _git add_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create the commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, you just have to commit using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git commit -m \"name_of_your_commit\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to give a name to your commit. It must be short and must clearly explain what you have done in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git commit -m \"add README.md\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review his commits\n",
    "\n",
    "It often happens that we make a mistake and want to go back to a previous version of our code. So you have two options for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python.\n",
    "git reset your_commit_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This will undo all commits you made after the commit you specified in your order. It won't erase the code you wrote in your local text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git reset --hard name_of_your_commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will erase the code you wrote locally and revert to the exact commit you specified in your command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: To find out the name of your commit, type the command\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see the different commits made and their names, as in the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=16x0HuljQ2aUxPq7qvreTx0UEOe59-Rve)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ignore files\n",
    "\n",
    "It often happens that you have files that you would not like to see public on the web. For example, you have a file that contains codes or API keys that are supposed to remain confidential.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what .gitignore is for. If you create a file that you name _.gitignore_, all filenames in it will be ignored by Git. So, for example, if you do a _git push, all the files that are in .gitignore won't be pushed into Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Rrm9a9K3iz8fDHNs-xOpBpUDwBXsQ2sM)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exporting to Github\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish and export everything to Github, you'll need to add something called a _remote_ that lets Git know where to export the code you wrote. So you'll need to type :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git remote add origin https://github.com/username_github/repository_name.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we added a _remote_ called _origin_ and the URL of _origin_ is _[https://github.com/username_github/repository_name.git](https://github.com/username_github/repository_name.git)_ which is the location of your repository in Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can enter the _push_ command that will be used to export your code. You will need to specify on which _remote_ you want to export the code. Here is the command :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git push origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You saw here that we also added the command _master_. This is the name of the branch to which we want to export our code. Here we exported it to the master branch. We will explain this concept in the next part.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it, your code is uploaded to your Github profile!\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB**: It's possible that the first time you do this, the console will ask you for your Github username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have an idea of how Git works, let's take a look at the most useful features of the tool to collaborate and improve your applications without ever breaking your code.\n",
