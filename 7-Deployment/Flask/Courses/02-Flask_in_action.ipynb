    "This code may be scary at first sight, but there is nothing complicated about it. Let's go line-by-line:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `From flask import Flask`: first, we import Flask like any other libraries.\n",
    "2. `app = Flask(__name__)` : here, we create an instance of the `Flask` class to which we pass the `__name__` parameter, which is used to determine the name of the application according to how it is started (as an application or as a module of an application). If the application is started as a main application `__name__` will be equal to `\"__main__\"`. In the other case, it will have the name of the file from which it is imported.\n",
    "3. `@app.route(\"/\"):` is what we call a _decorator_. In Flask it allows you to define the URL for a request. Anything below this decorator will define what to do to the URL we defined in the `.route()` method: this is also called a view. In this case, in our example, every time we go to the root URL, we have a `index()` function that will return \"Hello World!\".\n",
    "4. `if __name__ = \"__main__\":`: this code â€“ and what is underneath, send a message to Python that you are running this application if it is not a module of another application, but a full-fledged application.\n",

    "- `return jsonify(response), 200`: here we serialize our `response` dictionnary into a JSON format. Have you spotted the `200`? It is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\" target=\"_blank\">status code</a> for our response. It means everything is okay."
