    "\n",
    "If you've ever tried deploying any application on a server, you know how much of a hassle this can be. Here are just a few problems that can (and often will) occur when moving from your _development environment_ to your _production environment_:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Server's Operating System is not the same (i.e you are working on MacOS, server is Windows or Ubuntu)\n",
    "* Dependencies are not installed \n",
    "* Dependencies are not compatible \n",
    "* ... \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Docker is to alleviate these problems by letting you create _containers_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, Docker lets you package your machine learning model in order to create ready to deploy API. Or, it allows you to create a scheduled job running inside your precisely defined container. Or even, Docker gives you the tool to reproduce the production infrastructure locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker sounds to be the answer to a lot of issues in development and data engineering. Indeed, _it is_. This is why we would like you to tame the animal, supposing anyone can tame a whale...\n",

    "### Virtual machine\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual machine can be seen as \"a new computer running inside your computer\". This sentence sounds weird, isn't it? More precisely by running a virtual machine you are allocating hardware resources like RAM, computing power, and so on, to run a new operating system (OS). This OS could be a Linux distribution for example running on your _buddy ol' pal_ Windows. Or the opposite!\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual machines are quite handy if you need a whole new environment with its drivers (to pilot your hardware) and other freaky programmatic creatures. But, too often, they are heavy to support in memory and they take too much time on booting.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are still massively used in infrastructures. However Docker containers popped up with some interesting features bringing new solutions to problems that VM were unable to solve.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Containers are less heavy weight and run (also tear down) within seconds. It is why they are so cool! Also, they are sharing the same OS. We are not going to dive deep in how much this is awesome, but keep in mind this sharing mechanism allows containers to be less resource-consuming, and faster, and lightweight, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice we are not saying that VMs are bad. They are just not suited for some kinds of work, specifically when we just want to run one application.\n",

    "Our containers, which hold our applications, run on Docker sharing resources of the host system. It does a huge difference when it comes to scaling your application horizontally. Containers are faster to scale than VMs.\n",

    "Docker architecture mimics the way how client and server work together. The client communicates to the server in order to get datas or ask the server to do some computing. This is how the web works. Concerning Docker, most of the time the client is your machine and the server is a program called _Docker Daemon_. üòà\n",
    "\n",
    "A daemon is just a piece of software running in the background and listening for instructions. Just like a web server is waiting most of the time for HTTP requests, our daemon waits for command lines requests (even though Docker offers you more managing solutions).\n",

    "\n",
    "Docker heavily relies on these images to optimize its processes. Images are built with many layers which correspond to building blocks. Each time you will change something inside your container, Docker will update only the appropriate building block, everything else is cached from the previous build. Smart, isn't it?"

    "\n",
    "#### Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "_Volume_ is a shared folder used to persist data on the container machine. It allows different containers to share this common space.\n",
