This file contains all the instructions to build the container step by step, one instruction after the other. It is exactly like a recipe in which you describe the necessary steps to cook your cake. Docker will read steadily this recipe in the `Dockerfile` and build your container.\n",

With experience, you will know at your fingertips all the good images you could use. For now, trust us with `python:3.9-alpine` which is a lightweight image with Python 3.9 inside it (it will therefore be able to run python programs).\n",

    "The shell command `echo \"Cookies and cheesecakes are my favorites\" > favorites_cakes.txt` does the following thing: it displays `\"Cookies and cheesecakes are my favorites\"`, that is what `echo` does. More formally `echo` job is to print on standard out (aka stdout) ‚Äì¬†but it is a bit out of scope, just for you to know. Then we redirect this printing to a file using the symbol `>` followed by the file name `favorites_cakes.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we store the string `\"Cookies and cheesecakes are my favorites\"` into the file `favorites_cakes.txt`. Shell commands are a whole new world of hairy beasts.\n",

    "\n",
    "One last word about `RUN`: you are going to use it a _lot_. For example, try to add a `RUN pip install pandas`. What happens? You should have an error. And it is perfectly normal, you haven't done something bad, but, remember our base image is really simple. Our environment does not come with a bunch of libraries on which our beloved Pandas relies on. Thus, you may need to install them manually (using more `RUN`), or, you can find an image with the appropriate libraries as your base image. There are tons of them on <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a> and <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DockerHub</a>!"
