    "Conda is a package, dependency and environment manager. Package and dependency manager just like `pip`. It allows you to download and setup the library you need for your project without carrying about what others libraries your library will need to work properly. It is very convenient. Conda is also a environment manager like `virtualenv`. You may realize this now: it allows you to have your own Python interpreter and all the libraries available with one command. It becomes useful when you are working on different project at the same time or if you want to share a project with your mates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, you already understand all of that. What about <a href=\"https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html\" target=\"_blank\">Miniconda</a> or the better known <a href=\"https://docs.anaconda.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anaconda</a>?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a package with a lot of already available libraries for data-science. When you setup Anaconda on your computer, you are installing the latest version of Python, with data-science libraries like scikit-learn, Pandas ‚Äì¬†and many others, and some softwares in order to help you manage all these, like Anaconda Navigator. You have the choice to use Anaconda Navigator to manage your environments or to use the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Miniconda is a lightweight Anaconda. It comes with the basics: Python and some libraries. It is useful if you don't want to install all the softwares coming with Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We recommend you to install Anaconda as it comes with a lot of data-science libraries you will have to setup anyway. Also for **Windows** users üëã, it comes with really useful tools like Anaconda Navigator or Anaconda Powershell Prompt (a terminal we are going to use in the following part)."
