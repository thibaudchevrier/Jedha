If you want to learn more about the different types of distances in mathematics, check out our appendix. \n",

    "### Manhattan Distance (also called L1)\n",
    "\n",
    "It corresponds to the distance traveled on each axis to go from a point $x$ to a point $y$. Its mathematical formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{1}(x,y)=\\sum_{i=1}^{p}|x_i - y_i|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x$ and $y$ are two observations containing $p$ quantitative variables (qualitative variables should also be transformed into quantitative variables).\n",

    "This distance is useful for very large spaces, where it allows faster convergence of algorithms. In addition, this distance is less sensitive than others to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euclidean (also called L2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean distance is the most widely used distance in general, it is the distance as the crow flies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Euclidean\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1GQVDa0-SmkAxdgr6pHn0Z4HiIozLfLk2\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most widely used distance in practice, as it offers a good compromise between managing short and long distances.\n",
    "\n",

    "The following figure shows an illustration of the Euclidean distance in 3 dimensions:\n",
