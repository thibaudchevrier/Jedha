    "### The OOP structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by talking about the structure and vocabulary related to OOP, as this will make it easier for you to understand why we do it and the fundamental principles on which OOP is based. Here's the general structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **An object**: Anything can designate an object: a class is an object, a function is an object etc. When we don't know the type of data we are dealing with, we will talk about an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A class**: A class is a collection of methods, variables... that will allow to execute a certain number of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **An attribute**: These are the variables contained in a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **A method** : When we build functions, in a class, we are actually talking about methods. These functions have been used before, and are those that start with a dot (ex: _.pop()_)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **An instance**: An instance is an example of a class, that is, each time you are going to use a class, you are going to create an instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "These five vocabulary words are the ones you need to keep in mind. You're not going to understand them all right away, that's perfectly normal. We'll build classes and it'll all come together quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole purpose of OOP is to create code that is more robust, flexible and more easily reusable. It is based on 4 principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    "2. Abstract\n",
    "3. Heritage\n",
    "4. Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly explain each of these principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation**: In OOP, we have attributes nested in classes. This allows us to \"arrange\" the variables relative to the same object (for example, we will arrange in the same object the real and imaginary parts of a complex number). It is also very useful for hiding from the user variables that are useful for the operation of the code but whose values the user does not necessarily need to know or manipulate directly. This principle of having attributes nested in classes respects what is called encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** : Abstraction tells us that: \"If there is complex code that the user doesn't need, we might as well hide it\". The idea behind this is to prevent the user from bringing bugs into the programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heritage**: There can be a hierarchy in classes and methods. You can have parent classes and child classes that inherit the attributes of the parent class. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism** : Polymorphism is very much related to inheritance. It means that in addition to inheriting the attributes of the parent classes, each of the methods of the parent class can adapt to different possible situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help you understand how classes are built, but you don't have to rack your brains about it right now. You'll understand as we create classes."

    "### Create a class with its attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for creating a class will always be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Name_of_the_class():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, arguments_init): # special method for initializing internal attributes (optional if no internal attributes)\n",
    "        self.name_attribute1 = ...\n",
    "        self.name_attribute2 = ...\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def methode1(self, arguments_methode1):\n",
    "        instructions\n",
    "        return ... # optional\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def methode2(self, arguments_methode2):\n",
    "        instructions\n",
    "        return ... # optional\n",
    "        \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__() method is a special method: it is the one that will be called each time a class instance is created. It determines how the attributes will be initialized. As soon as your class contains internal attributes, you should think about defining the __init()__. Sometimes you may create a class that has no internal attributes. In this case, you don't need the __init()__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the class has been declared, we will be able to create as many instances of the class as we want, in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name_instance1 = Name_of_the_class(arguments_init)\n",
    "name_instance2 = Name_of_the_class(arguments_init)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the class instance has been created, its internal attributes can then be accessed in this way :\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name_instance1.name_attribute1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for each instance, it will be possible to call the methods declared within the class, in this way :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name_instance1.methode1(arguments_methode1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: each method defined in the class has a list of arguments that starts with a particular keyword, denoted `self`. In python, `self` represents the instance of the class and is always the first argument to a method. It is because we write `methode1(self,...)` that we can then call the method with a dot: `instance_name1.method1(...)`. If you forget the `self' argument when defining the method, you will get an error when trying to call the method."
